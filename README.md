# Delta-Hedging-Greeks

Delta-Hedging-Greeks is a Streamlit application that demonstrates delta hedging strategies and computes option Greeks using both analytical formulas (via the Black-Scholes model and Merton jump-diffusion) and pathwise sensitivity methods. The app is modular, with each component organized into separate files and then combined into one interactive interface.

## Overview

This project provides an interactive Streamlit app for simulating delta hedging strategies using both the classical Black-Scholes framework and jump-diffusion models. In addition, it computes option Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega) via analytical methods and pathwise sensitivity using Monte Carlo simulation.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Simulations:** Visualize asset paths, option prices, and hedging performance in real time.
- **Black-Scholes Model:** Price European options and compute Greeks analytically.
- **Jump-Diffusion Model:** Incorporate jumps into asset dynamics using the Merton model.
- **Pathwise Sensitivity:** Estimate Delta and Vega from simulated paths.
- **Modular Codebase:** Organized into separate files for models, sensitivity analysis, and utilities.
- **Streamlit Interface:** User-friendly dashboard for exploring different scenarios.

## Theoretical Background

### Black-Scholes Model

The Black-Scholes model assumes that the underlying asset follows a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM):

$$
dS_t = r S_t\, dt + \sigma S_t\, dW_t,
$$

where:
- \( S_t \) is the asset price at time \( t \),
- \( r \) is the risk-free rate,
- \( \sigma \) is the volatility,
- \( dW_t \) is the increment of a Wiener process.

The solution to the GBM is given by:

$$
S_T = S_0 \exp\left(\left(r - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\right)T + \sigma W_T\right).
$$

The Black-Scholes formula for a European call option is:

$$
C = S_0 N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2),
$$

with

$$
d_1 = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{S_0}{K}\right) + \left(r + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\right)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}, \quad
d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T},
$$

and where \( N(\cdot) \) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.

### Delta Hedging

Delta hedging involves offsetting the directional risk of an option by trading the underlying asset. The **Delta** of an option is defined as:

$$
\Delta = \frac{\partial C}{\partial S_0}.
$$

For a call option in the Black-Scholes model, this simplifies to:

$$
\Delta_{\text{call}} = N(d_1).
$$

This value represents the sensitivity of the option price to a small change in the underlying asset price.

### Jump-Diffusion Models

The Merton jump-diffusion model extends GBM by incorporating random jumps:

$$
dS_t = S_t \left( r\, dt + \sigma\, dW_t + \left(e^J - 1\right)dN_t \right),
$$

where:
- \( N_t \) is a Poisson process with intensity \( \xi \),
- \( J \) is a normally distributed jump size with mean \( \mu_J \) and variance \( \sigma_J^2 \).

The terminal asset price becomes:

$$
S_T = S_0 \exp\left[\left(r - \xi\left(e^{\mu_J + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_J^2} - 1\right) - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\right)T + \sigma W_T + \sum_{i=1}^{N_T} J_i\right].
$$

### Pathwise Sensitivity for Greeks

Pathwise methods estimate the Greeks by differentiating the payoff function along each simulated path.

- **Pathwise Delta:**

  $$ 
  \Delta \approx e^{-rT} \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} \frac{S_T^{(i)}}{S_0} \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\{S_T^{(i)} > K\}},
  $$

  where \( \mathbf{1}_{\{S_T^{(i)} > K\}} \) is an indicator function that is 1 if \( S_T^{(i)} > K \) and 0 otherwise.

- **Pathwise Vega:**

  $$
  \text{Vega} \approx e^{-rT} \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} \mathbf{1}_{\{S_T^{(i)} > K\}} \cdot \frac{S_T^{(i)}}{\sigma} \left( \ln\left(\frac{S_T^{(i)}}{S_0}\right) - \left(r + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\right)T \right).
  $$

These estimators help verify the analytical Greek values and assess the sensitivity of option prices to underlying parameters.
